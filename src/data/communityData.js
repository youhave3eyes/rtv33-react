The clarity is unreal. Seeing energy fields around people, lucid dreaming every night, and my manifestations are coming faster than ever.

Anyone else experienced extended fasting? The spiritual benefits are profound. Your body becomes a crystal receiver when you clear it completely. 💎✨`,

The energy is PALPABLE. Sitting inside for 20 minutes feels like a full body reset. My plants are thriving, my sleep has improved dramatically, and I swear time moves differently in there.

If you're in the Denver area, I'm hosting a workshop next month where we'll build these together. DM me for details! Let's spread this technology. 🔮`,

Every morning I ask myself: "What frequency am I broadcasting today?"

Fear? Doubt? Lack? Or Love? Abundance? Gratitude?

Saw the interconnectedness of ALL things. Every atom vibrating with intelligence. Past traumas literally dissolved as light. Mother Ayahuasca showed me my purpose.

If you're called to plant medicine, trust that calling. But do your research, find ethical facilitators, and prepare your mind/body. This isn't recreation - it's sacred work.`,
